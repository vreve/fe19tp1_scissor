What is quire?
Quire is a notebook-app that is implemented directly in the browser. This early version saves the notes locally without any backend. 
Quire uses the open-source editor Quill to work properly. https://github.com/quilljs/quill

Features:
Delete notes
Mark notes as "favorites"
Print notes as document/pdf
Quill-implemented editor
Add pictures
Change font sizes and font styles
Dark Mode
Responsive on all platforms
Coloring notes

Upcoming Features:
Search for notes
 
How To Use The App:
Quire is easy to use and has an intuitive design. The navbar on the left (in the bottom if used on a mobile) has symbols that are easy to understand and guides you through your whole quire experience and the text editor to the right takes up most of the space so you can feel free to write down as much as you would like.
